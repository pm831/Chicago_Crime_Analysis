## Abstract:
Every day, there are a numerous amount of crimes that occur across the country and the world. This can include major metropolitan areas with high populations and business activity. In this analysis, we look at the city of Chicago. What makes a Chicago dangerous? What types of crimes occur in within Chicago, primarily at the zip level? Which zips/areas have the highest concentration of crimes? What is the level of 'seriousness' for these crimes? Which zips/areas have the highest concentration of serious crimes? And after find that out, what days/times do they occur?  All of these questions are looked at in the analysis below.
